  comments: This piece was created at the start of the Black Lives Matter protests in 2020. Through animation, Loulou challenges the lack of representation found in Renaissance imagery that depict goddesses, such as <i>Birth of Venus.</i>
  #In Loulou's own words, "These representations have formed a standard of what was perceived as beautiful during that era and which still affects the ideals of the present."
