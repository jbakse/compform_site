## Pixels

Today, most computers use color displays that produce images using a grid of pixels. Often each color pixel is made up of three sub-pixels—red, green, and blue—though the actual hardware may use a different pattern. Because these pixels are small and close together, the image appears continuous. Because our eyes can only directly distinguish red, green, and blue light, the screen can reproduce most of the colors we are capable of seeing.

When you work with a graphics library like p5.js or the JavaScript [Canvas API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API), you don't have to think about individual pixels. You can use high-level methods like `ellipse()` and `image()`, and the library will do the low-level work of setting individual pixel values for you. This process of drawing shapes with pixels is called _rasterization_. Because the p5.js drawing calls handle the details of rasterization for you, you give up some control. When you draw a circle with `ellipse()` every pixel in the circle will be changed to the current `fill()` color. The p5.js library provides no way to fill the ellipse with random colors, or a gradient, or colors generated by a function. To get this level of control, you need to take control of the rasterization yourself. This is the classic high-level/low-level trade-off: coding at a low level takes more work but offers more control.

### Vector Monitors

Computer displays don't have to use pixels at all. One of the earliest video games, [Tennis for Two](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis_for_Two), used a cathode ray oscilloscope as its display. In a cathode ray oscilloscope, signals are drawn by magnetically deflecting a beam of electrons as they race from an emitter—the cathode—towards a phosphor-coated glass screen. The phosphor glows where the electrons strike it, creating an image. This type of display can show smooth lines without any of the aliasing artifacts of a pixel display.

[Vector Monitors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_monitor) were used in later video games as well, including the [Tempest](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tempest_(video_game)>) arcade game and several games for the [Vectrex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vectrex) home console.

This [high/low level](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-_and_low-level) tradeoff has some important implications for the creative coder. When you work at a high level you are not responsible for the details. Because you are not responsible for the details you tend to think about them less. Working directly with the pixels leads to thinking about drawing with code differently.

### Video Memory

Modern video pipelines are complicated, but at a basic level they work something like this: The red, green, and blue brightness values of every pixel on a display are stored in the computers RAM. In computers with a dedicated video card, this data is usually stored on the video card's VRAM. Once per display refresh, the video hardware reads this data from memory, pixel by pixel, and sends it to the display over a display interface like DVI or HDMI. Hardware in the display receives this data and updates the brightness of each pixel as needed. If you change the values in the RAM, you will see the changes reflected on the screen.

The memory used to store the screen's image is called the video buffer or framebuffer. Direct access to the screen's framebuffer is pretty unusual on modern computers, and high level libraries like p5.js don't (and can't) provide it. But P5.js does give you access to a pixel buffer storing the image shown on your sketch's canvas. When you call drawing functions like `rect()` and `ellipse()`, p5.js updates the appropriate values in this buffer. The buffer is then composited into the rendered webpage by the browser. The browser window is composited onto the display's framebuffer by the operating system and video hardware. The p5.js library provides two ways to directly read and set the color of a single pixel: `get()/set()` and the `pixels[]` array. Using `get()` and `set()` is easier, but using the `pixels[]` array is faster. This chapter has examples for using both.

<div class="callout">

A high-definition display is 1920 pixels wide and 1080 tall: 345,600 total pixels. Each pixel needs three bytes to represent its color value: one byte each for the red, green, and blue channels. In total that is 6,220,800 bytes—about 6 megabytes—of memory to keep track of the full HD image.

Today, 6 megabytes isn't much, but many older computers didn't even have enough RAM to keep an entire full-color image of the screen in memory at all. These computers used lower resolutions, limited palettes, and a [variety of tricks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tfh0ytz8S0k) to output to screen.

## Writing Pixel Data

### Random Pixels Example

This example uses `set()` to set each pixel in a 10x10 image to a random color. This example doesn't write to the canvas pixels directly. Instead, it creates an empty image, writes to its pixels, and then draws the image to the canvas. This approach is more flexible and avoids the complexities of [pixelDensity](https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/pixelDensity). This also lets us draw the image scaled-up so you can see the pixels easier.

{% js-lab "sketches/basic_pixels.js" %}

Let's look at the code in depth.

**Line 10:** Use `createImage()` to create a new, empty 10x10 image in memory. We can draw this image just like an image loaded from a `.jpg` or `.gif`.

**Line 11:** Use `loadPixels()` to tell p5 that we want to access the pixels of the image for reading or writing. You must call `loadPixels()` before using `set()`, `get()`, or the `pixels[]` array.

**Line 13:** Set up a nested loop. The inner content of the loop will be run once for every pixel.

**Line 15:** Use the `color()` function to create a color value, which is assigned to `c`. Color values hold the R, G, B, and A values of a color. The color function takes into account the current `colorMode()`.

**Line 16:** Use `set()` to set the color of the pixel at `x, y`.

**Line 20:** Use `updatePixels()` to tell p5 we are done accessing the pixels of the image.

**Line 22:** Use `noSmooth()` to tell p5 not to smooth the image when we scale it: we want it pixelated. This resembles Photoshop's 'nearest neighbor' scaling method.

**Line 23:** Draw the image, scaling up so we can clearly see each pixel.

### Gradient Example

This example has the same structure as the first one, but draws a gradient pixel-by-pixel.

{% js-lab "sketches/basic_pixels_2.js" %}

**Line 15:** Instead of choosing a color at random, this example calculates a color based on the current `x` and `y` position of the pixel being set.

### Random Access Example

The first two examples use a nested loop to set a value for every pixel in the image. The loop visits every pixel in a sequential order. That tactic is commonly used in pixel generating and processing scripts, but not always. This example places red pixels at random places on the image.

   {continue}

</div>

## Reading + Processing Pixel Data

The p5.js library also allows you to read pixel data, so you can process images or use images as inputs. These examples use this low-res black-and-white image of Earth.

![world.png](sketches/world.png){scale pixel}

### Read Pixels Example 1

This example loads the image of Earth, loops over its pixels, and white pixels to red and black pixels to blue.

{% js-lab "sketches/read_pixels_alt.js" %}

#### First we need to load an image to read pixel data from.

**Line 3:** Declare a variable to hold our image.

**Line 5:** The `preload()` function. Use this function to load assets. p5.js will wait until all assets are loaded before calling `setup()` and `draw()`

**Line 6:** Load the image.

#### With our image loaded we can process the pixels.

**Line 16:** Set up a nested loop to cover every pixel.

**Line 18:** Use `get()` to load the color data of the current pixel. `get()` returns an array like `[255, 0, 0, 255]` with components for red, green, blue, and alpha.

**Lines 22:** Read the red component of the color. We could also access directly like this: `in_color[0]`

**Line 25:** Check if the red value is 255 to see if it is black or white. Since we know the image is only black and white this is enough to check.

**Line 26 and Line 28:** Set `out_color` to red or blue.

**Line 31:** Set the pixel's color to `out_color`.

**Line 35:** Use `updatePixels()` to tell the image that we have updated the pixel array.

<!-- <div class="callout">
This callout is thankfully out of date!

Every time we switch from setting to getting pixel values, we have to call `updatePixels()`. This is because internally, p5.js will call `loadPixels()` when we call `get()` which will overwrite our changes in the pixel array. This extra updating and loading is why `get()` and `set()` are slower than accessing the `pixels[]` array directly.

### Read Pixels Example 2

This example compares each pixel to the one below it. If the upper pixel is darker, it is changed to magenta.

{% js-lab "sketches/read_pixels_2.js" %}

### Image as Input Example

1. Change the `lightness()` comparison to `!=`. `•`
1. Add an `else` block that changes the pixels to black. `••`
1. Starting with the original code without any changes, set the `out_color` to the average of `this_color` and `below_color`. Here is an example you could follow:`•••`

var color_b = color(worldImage.get(0, 2));
var blended_color = lerpColor(color_a, color_b, 0.5);
```

1. Change `worldImage.set(x, y, out_color);` to `worldImage.set(x, y+1, out_color);`. `•••`
1. Remove the `if` statement (but not its contents) so that its content always runs. `•••`
   {continue}

### Modify Read Pixels Example 3

1. Adjust the expression that determines `dot_size` to make the result prettier. `••`
   {continue}

</div>

## Working Directly with the `pixels[]` Array

You can read and write individual pixel values with the `get()` and `set()` methods. These methods are easy to use, but they are really slow. A faster approach is to use `loadPixels()` and `updatePixels()` to copy the canvas or image data to and from the [pixels[]](https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/pixels) array. Then, with a little bit of math, you can work directly with the `pixels[]` array data. This is a little more work but can run **hundreds of times faster**.

<!--
### Performance

The built-in p5 `get()` function gets the RGBA values of a pixel in an image. Internally `get()` calls `loadPixels()` to make sure it is working with up-to-date information. This means that even when getting the values for a single pixel, _every_ pixel is read _every_ time you call `get()`. As noted in the [reference](https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/get), this makes `get()` slower than accessing the values in the `pixels[]` array directly. In fact, `get()` can easily be 1000s of times slower.

<div class="callout">

The `get()` call is slow, and gets slower the larger your image is.

A `10 x 10` image has `100` pixels. Reading each pixel reloads all `100` pixel values. That means `10,000` pixel values are copied from the image into pixels[] array.

A `50 x 50` image has `2,500` pixels. Reading each pixel reloads all `2,500` pixels. That is `6,250,000` pixels copied.

A `1,920 x 1,080` image has `2,073,600` pixels. Reading all of those pixels with `get()` would require copying `4,299,816,960,000` pixels, but your browser will hang or crash first.

</div> -->

We can get much faster results by loading all of the pixel values with `loadPixels()`, and then reading and writing the `pixels[]` array directly. Since we are reading from `pixels[]` ourselves, we can bypass the safety measures that slow down `get()` like bounds checking. We have to be a little more careful about what we are doing, though, or we might create bugs.

The `getQuick()` and `setQuick()` functions below read and write a pixel's color value from an image's `pixels[]` array. You must call `loadPixels()` before calling these functions. When you are done working with the `pixels[]` array, you should call `updatePixels()` to update the image with your changes.

```javascript
// getQuick()
// find the RGBA values of the pixel at `x`, `y` in the pixel array of `img`
// unlike get() this functions only supports getting a single pixel
// it also doesn't do any bounds checking or other checks
//
// we don't need to worry about screen pixel density here, because we are
// not reading from the screen, just an image

function getQuick(img, x, y) {
  const i = (y * img.width + x) * 4;
  return [
    img.pixels[i],
    img.pixels[i + 1],
    img.pixels[i + 2],
    img.pixels[i + 3],
  ];
}

// setQuick()
// set the RGBA values of the pixel at `x`, `y` in the pixel array of `img`
// unlike set() this functions only supports setting a single pixel
// it doesn't work with a p5 color object
// it also doesn't do any bounds checking or other checks

function setQuick(img, x, y, c) {
  const i = (y * img.width + x) * 4;

  img.pixels[i + 0] = c[0];
  img.pixels[i + 1] = c[1];
  img.pixels[i + 2] = c[2];
  img.pixels[i + 3] = c[3];
}
```

Copy the `getQuick()` function above into your sketch. You can then replace a built-in p5 `get` call with a call to `getQuick`:

#### Using `get()`

```javascript
// in loop
c = img.get(x, y);
```

#### Using `getQuick()`

```javascript
// before loop
img.loadPixels();

// in loop
c = getQuick(img, x, y);

// after loop
img.updatePixels();
```

### `get()` vs `getQuick()`

The following example compares the performance of using `get() and set()` with `getQuick() and setQuick()` to read and invert the color values in a small image. On my machine, using `get()` takes about 30 times longer than `getQuick()` for small images and about 250 times longer for large images.

{% js-lab "sketches/performance.js" %}

### The Canvas + Pixel Density

You can work with the pixels in an image using `image.pixels[]` or the pixels of the canvas with just `pixels[]`.
When accessing the pixel data of the canvas itself, you need to consider the pixel density p5 is using. By default, p5 will create a high-dpi canvas when running on a high-dpi (retina) display. You can call `pixelDensity(1)` before creating your canvas to disable this feature. Otherwise, you'll need to take into account the density when calculating a position in the `pixels[]` array.

The examples on this page work with the pixels of images instead of the canvas to avoid this issue altogether. If you need to work with the canvas, the [pixels](https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/pixels) documentation has info on working with higher pixel densities.

<!--
### Using the `pixels` array

The p5.js `pixels` array holds four color values—red, green, blue, and alpha—for every pixel on the canvas. Images are two dimensional, but the `pixels` array is one dimensional. In order to read or write values in the `pixels` array, you need to find the index—the position in the array—of your target pixel. To do that, you need to know how the data is laid out. In p5.js the upper left pixel is the first pixel in the array and the other pixels follow left to right, top to bottom. Each pixel is represented by four values: red, green, blue, and alpha.

```
[r, g, b, a, r, g, b, a, r, g, b, a, r, g, b, a, r, g, b, a, r, g, b, a, ...]
 --- p1 ---  --- p2 ---  --- p3 ---  --- p4 ---  --- p5 ---  --- p6 ---
```

With data laid out like this we can find the index values as follows.

```
pixelNumber = y * imageWidth + x;
redIndex = pixelNumber * 4;
greenIndex = pixelNumber * 4 + 1;
blueIndex = pixelNumber * 4 + 2;
alphaIndex = pixelNumber * 4 + 3;
```

[[ diagram ]]

<div class="callout">  .warn
On a high-dpi or retina display, the canvas array may have more values than you expect. When you call `createCanvas(512,512)` on a high pixel density display, p5.js actually creates a canvas that is 1024x1024, or potentially even larger if the display pixel density is very large.
