  comments: On Kawara worked on this series for nearly five decades. The paintings were produced meticulously over the course of many hours according to a series of steps that never varied. If a painting was not finished by midnight, he destroyed it. The quasi-mechanical element of his routine makes the production of each painting an exercise in meditation.

  comments: Dwarf Fortress is an uncompromising game created entirely by Tarn and Zach Adams. Dwarf Fortress procedurally generates and simulates the game world in crazy detail.

  comments: An (overly) ambitious title that uses procedural generation to create a galaxy of planets, each with their own geology and ecosystems. The game's initial release was seen as disappointing by many, as it failed to deliver on some heavily-promoted features.
