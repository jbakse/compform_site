  comments: Dwarf Fortress is a cult-classic game created entirely by Tarn and Zach Adams. Dwarf Fortress procedurally generates and simulates the game world in crazy detail.

#   comments: An (overly) ambitious title that uses procedural generation to create a galaxy of planets, each with their own geology and ecosystems. The game's initial release was seen as disappointing by many, as it failed to deliver on some heavily-promoted features.
