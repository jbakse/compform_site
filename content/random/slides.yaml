  comments: Amy created these constellation-like forms, each unique because of its random placement of nodes and connections.

- artist: Marcel Duchamp
  title: 3 Standard Stoppages, 1913

  comments: Marcel Duchamp dropped three horizontal threads onto three stretched canvases, where they were then adhered, in order to preserve the random curves they assumed upon landing. The canvases were cut along those curves, creating a template for new units of measure that retain the meter’s length but undermine its rational basis.
